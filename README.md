## Description

This is the second project in the Udacity Nanodegree Program, Front End Developer.
In this project I was presented an HTML structure and CSS styling, with there were 3 different tasks to do.

Task 1: With JS, create a navigation dynamaically as an unordered list, based on how many sections there are and sections Id and data.

Task 2: Make sure that the section being viewed is highlighted in some way, such as an 'active-class'.

Task 3: Clicking on an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropiate section.
